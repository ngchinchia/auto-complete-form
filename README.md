## :question: FAQ
1. **Q: How do I implement asynchronous search?**
   A: Use the `isAsync` prop and provide an `onAsyncSearch` function to fetch results.

2. **Q: Can I use this component with JavaScript instead of TypeScript?**
   A: Yes, but you'll need to remove type annotations and may lose some type safety benefits.
